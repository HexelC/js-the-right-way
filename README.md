## Introducing JavaScript Object
### Directory: js-object-basics
In this directory I follow the tutorial found on Mozilla's developer site on [Introducing JavaScript Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects). I've coded procedural JS scripts for years, and I've done a lot of OOP in PHP. I'm taking this tutorial to brush up my OOP skills for JavaScript in particular.
